# HPC Assignment 2025

This repository contains the implementation, experiments, and documentation for the **High Performance Computing (HPC) Assignment – Academic Year 2024–2025**.

The project focuses on the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of **parallel and distributed computing solutions** using modern HPC paradigms, including **MPI**, **CUDA**, and **OpenMP**. Each exercise targets a different class of computational problems and explores scalability, resource utilization, and performance trade-offs on parallel architectures.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment is composed of **three main exercises**, each addressing a core topic in high-performance computing:

1. **Systolic Array for Matrix Multiplication (MPI)**  
   Implementation of a distributed systolic array architecture for large-scale matrix multiplication, evaluated across multiple matrix sizes and configurations.

2. **Multi-Dimensional Data Processing with Stencils (CUDA)**  
   GPU-based implementation of image filtering using stencil operations, applied to high-resolution images (4K–16K), with performance and noise-reduction analysis.

3. **2D Heat Diffusion Simulation (OpenMP)**  
   A shared-memory parallel simulation of heat diffusion on a 2D grid using finite difference methods, including isotropic and anisotropic models.

Each exercise includes performance measurements, scalability analysis, and experimental evaluation as required by the assignment specification :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## Repository Objectives
